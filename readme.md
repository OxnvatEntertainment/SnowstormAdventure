As Noodle is making a game on his computer, he craves a bottle of Spite. The problem is, it's the middle of a snowstorm, and killer snowmen are marching in the streets of Chestershire! Will Noodle make it to the corner store and get a Spite before it closes, or will he get jumped by snowmen and die of hypothermia?

# Story
As Noodle is making a game on his computer, he craves a bottle of Spite. The problem is, it's the middle of a snowstorm, and killer snowmen are marching in the streets of Chestershire! Will Noodle make it to the corner store and get a Spite before it closes, or will he get jumped by snowmen and die of hypothermia?
# Characters and Items
## Noodle
The main character of The Toon Teens Comic, Noodle sets out to get a bottle of Spite from the corner store to resume his programming.
## Snowman
Forged from the snows of New Hampshire, Snowmen rule the streets during snowstorms. Surprisingly, they are vulnerable to snowballs, and especially vulnerable to lemon-lime Spite. They are worth 20 points times what stage Noodle is on.
## Spite
When Noodle is being overwhelmed by the snowmen, he can shake up a Spite and sweep all of the snowmen from the screen. Snowmen defeated from a soda blast are worth half as many points.
